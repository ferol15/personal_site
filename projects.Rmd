For my dissertation, I use an online survey experiment fielded in Turkey in 2018 to test threat politics' effect upon conservatism. I differentiate between diverse types of death reminders (e.g. death due to cancer, to terror attack, and death under complete uncertainty). And I check how the big five personality traits moderate these death reminders' effect on conservatism. 

<br>
Additionally, I have several working papers on electoral budget cycles, foreign policy behavior, personality traits - political behavior links, and political parties.
