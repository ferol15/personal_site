My research builds on core theories of political behavior and political psychology in tandem with psychophysiological research insights. My first stream of research examines the role of threats (reminders of death) in political ideology. I fielded Qualtrics-based online survey experiments in Turkey (2018, 2020, nationally non-representative Facebook and Instagram samples) and the U.S. (2020, nationally representative Prolific sample) to assess how and why health (e.g., cancer and a coronavirus disease), morality (e.g., a drunk driving crash, domestic violence), security (e.g., a terrorist attack) and unknown threats to survival have potent effects on people’s affinity for conservative self-identification and policy positions. I also have a research proposal accepted by the Mexican research center Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE, Center for Research and Teaching in Economics), which is fielding my doctoral experimental design on the student sample visiting their labs in Mexico during the 2020-2021 academic year.  

<br>
My second stream of research considers the intersection of sleep-wake preferences (chronotype) and politics. I have started to examine how deviations from the social organization of time, such as the differences in chronotype and sleep duration, are related to differences in left-right ideological placements, level of religious attendance, and political participation, comparatively, in Finland, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, and the US.

<br> 
My third stream of research uses methods from the study of personality traits to develop new insights into a diverse set of political attitudes and behaviors, including the associations between the <i>Big Five Personality</i> traits and (i) religiosity, (ii) identification with the conservative political parties, (iii) candidate traits evaluations, (iv) foreign policy attitudes, and (v) state of emergency.

<br>
My fourth and last stream of research is on the text-as-data analyses. I was one of the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR) coders for the Turkish election texts for the 2015 and 2018 Turkish elections. I was also a newspaper coder for the project titled ‘Press−Party Parallelism in Turkey’ for the 2015 Turkish elections. Besides, I research the election texts as data in party competition. I inquire which parties and party families use simple language in their election manifestos and whether simple election documents resonate with voters’ most pressing problems depicted in open-ended survey responses before the elections. These content analysis studies use quantitative text analyses, particularly text mining and natural language processing, to quantify the common and uncommon words’ frequency, complexity, and sentiment across several election documents. Further, I am invested in text scaling and document classification, particularly of election manifestos, campaign speeches, and Tweets.

<br>
As an actively involved doctoral research assistant at Koç University, I gained experience in several national and cross-national face-to-face survey projects. I curated the nationally representative survey samples from Turkey per Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Modules IV to V and International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) 2014 Citizenship II Module coding structure. Besides survey data management, I helped my research advisors in the sampling and questionnaire design and weight calculation for the nationally representative face-to-face surveys in Turkey led by CSES, ISSP, and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK, for the project titled Populist Attitudes and Values Research in Turkey). In addition to these face-to-face surveys, I assisted the Qualtrics questionnaire design and scaling and Facebook and Instagram sampling of the Turkish Voting Advice Application project (<a href="http://oypusulasi.org/)">oypusulasi.org</a>) for March 31, 2019, Local Elections in Istanbul, Turkey.

<br>
I was an actively involved teaching assistant for several quantitative research methodology courses at undergraduate and graduate levels by leading the lab and problem sessions on SPSS, Stata, and multivariate regression models at Koç University.

<br>
I have practical experience in survey research, categorical data analysis, mixed-effects models, and structural equation modeling. Least to say, I am a proficient user of R and Qualtrics Survey Design.
