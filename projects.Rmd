<p style="color:black"> My dissertation considered the alignment between threats to survival and political conservatism and employs Qualtrics-based survey experiments informed by several psychophysiological insights (e.g., <i>Negativity Bias</i>, <i>Motivated Social Cognition</i>, and <i>Terror Management Theory</i>). For my doctoral and predoctoral research, I fielded online survey experiments in Turkey (2018, 2020, nationally non-representative Facebook and Instagram sample) and the U.S. (2020, nationally representative Prolific sample) to assess how and why health (e.g., cancer and a coronavirus disease [COVID-19]), morality (e.g., a drunk driving crash, domestic violence), security (e.g., a terrorist attack) and unknown threats to survival have potent effects on people’s affinity for conservative self-identification and policy positions (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09546553.2022.2060081">[1] </a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14683857.2023.2189541">[2] </a>). </p>

<br>
<p style="color:black"> Another stream of my research considers the intersection of sleep and politics. I have started to examine how deviations from the social organization of time, such as the differences in sleep-wake preferences (chronotype) and the extent of sleep duration, are related to differences in left-right ideological placements, level of religious attendance, and political participation, comparatively, in Finland, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, and the US (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2022.102491">[3]</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edac020">[4]</a>). </p>

<br> 
<p style="color:black"> My third stream of research uses methods from the study of personality traits to develop new insights into a diverse set of political attitudes and behaviors, including the associations between the <i>Big Five Personality</i> traits and (i) religiosity, (ii) identification with the conservative political parties, (iii) candidate traits evaluations, (iv) foreign policy attitudes, and (v) state of emergency. </p>
 
<br>
<p style="color:black"> My fourth and last stream of research is on the text-as-data analyses. I was one of the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR) coders for the Turkish election texts for the 2015 and 2018 Turkish elections. I was also a newspaper coder for the project titled "Press−Party Parallelism in Turkey" for the 2015 Turkish elections. Besides, I research the election texts as data in party competition. I inquire which parties and party families use simple language in their election manifestos and whether simple election documents resonate with voters’ most pressing problems depicted in open-ended survey responses before the elections (see <a href="https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=C3NKEAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT12&ots=PeroulwhJ7&dq=info%3AyPFgPM2Z3NQJ%3Ascholar.google.com&lr&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false)">[5]</a>). These content analysis studies use quantitative text analyses, particularly text mining and natural language processing, to quantify the common and uncommon words’ frequency, complexity, and sentiment across several election documents. Further, I am invested in text scaling and document classification, particularly of election manifestos, campaign speeches, and Tweets. </p>
