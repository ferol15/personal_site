In my dissertation, I ask two broader questions (i) '<u>is political conservatism the only well-suited ideology to handling life-threatening traumatic events?</u>', and (ii) '<u>are other ideologies, such as liberalism, not well suited to reducing anxiety, fear, and uncertainty of threats?</u>' Accordingly, I fielded a non-representative online survey experiment in Turkey in 2018 to examine how reminders of death due to cancer, terror attack, and unknown causes affect individuals' levels of conservatism and liberalism. I argue that <i>the Big Five Personality Traits</i> influence individuals to differentiate out-groups and in-groups behind the threats, and then, affect whether those individuals come to hold more conservative or liberal identifications and policy positions. And during my predoctoral visit at the UIUC, I have been trying to comparatively analyze my dissertation-related hypotheses by collecting experimental data among a non-representative sample of American citizens. 

<br>
I also have several manuscripts on personality traits' links to vote choices in presidential elections, religiosity, and foreign policy attitudes. Besides, I have working papers on text/manifesto-based dynamics of party competition, chronotypes and political behaviors relationships, and electoral budget cycles.

<br> 
Least to say, at Koc University, I have been a teaching assistant for various quantitative research methodology courses at undergraduate and graduate levels by leading the lab and problem sessions on SPSS, Stata, and multivariate regression models.
