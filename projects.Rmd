My research expands on core theories of political behavior and political psychology by integrating insights drawn from psychophysiological research. My first stream of research examines the role of threats (reminders of death) in political ideology. I ask how and why health (a coronavirus disease), morality (a drunk driving crash), and security (a terrorist attack) threats to survival have potent effects on people’s affinity for conservative self-identification and policy positions. To answer my questions and assess my expectations, I have fielded online survey experiments in Turkey (2018, 2020) and the United States (2020). These studies use qualitative and quantitative research designs (cognitive interviews for the survey instruments’ comprehension in English and Turkish, and online survey experiments), and diverse samples (student and non-student [online] samples in Turkey and the U.S.). Besides, I have a research proposal accepted by the Mexican research center Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE) (Center for Research and Teaching in Economics), which will field my threats-related experimental design on the student sample visiting their labs in Mexico next fall. 

<br>
My second stream of research considers the intersection of sleep-wake preferences (chronotype) and politics. I have started to examine how deviations from the social organization of time, such as the differences in chronotype and sleep duration, are related to differences in left-right ideological placements, level of religious attendance, and political participation, comparatively, in Finland, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, and Switzerland.

<br> 
My third stream of research uses methods from the study of personality traits to develop new insights into a diverse set of political attitudes and behaviors, including the associations between the <i>Big Five Personality</i> traits and (i) religiosity, (ii) identification with the conservative political parties, (iii) candidate traits evaluations, (iv) foreign policy attitudes, and (v) states of emergencies.

<br>
My fourth and last stream of research is on the text-as-data analyses. I was one of the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR) coders for the Turkish election texts for the 2015 and 2018 Turkish elections. I was also a newspaper coder for the project titled ‘Press−Party Parallelism in Turkey’ for the 2015 Turkish elections. Besides, I research the election texts as data in party competition. I inquire which parties and party families use simple language in their election manifestos and whether simple election documents resonate with voters’ most pressing problems depicted in open-ended survey responses before the elections. These content analysis studies use quantitative text analyses, particularly text mining and natural language processing, to quantify the common and uncommon words’ frequency, complexity, and sentiment across several election documents.

<br>
I was an actively involved teaching assistant for several quantitative research methodology courses at undergraduate and graduate levels by leading the lab and problem sessions on SPSS, Stata, and multivariate regression models at Koc University.

<br>
Likewise, at Koc University, I was an active research assistant in several national and cross-national projects to design and code the nationally representative surveys in Turkey led by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), and the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). In doing so, I have practical experience in survey research, categorical data analysis, mixed-effects models, and structural equation modeling. Least to say, I am a proficient user of R and Qualtrics Survey Design.
