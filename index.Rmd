I am a recent Ph.D. graduate in Political Science at Koc University, Department of International Relations and Political Science in Istanbul, Turkey. I held a predoctoral fellowship (2019-2020) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Political Science. I got my B.A. (2013) in Political Science and International Relations at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey and received my M.A. (2015) in International Relations at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. My primary track is in comparative politics. I am interested in text-as-data research, political attitude, behavior, and experimental methodology.
