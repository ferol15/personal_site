<p style="color:black">I received my Ph.D. from Koç University (in Istanbul, Turkey) in November 2020, with the dissertation titled “Rising Conservatism in the Face of Threats.” I held a predoctoral fellowship (2019-2020) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Department of Political Science. My primary research agenda examines political behavior and psychology, experimental analysis, survey research, and text as data methods.</p>
