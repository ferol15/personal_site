I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Koc University, Department of International Relations in Istanbul, Turkey. I got my B.A. (2013) in Political Science and International Relations at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey and received my M.A. (2015) in International Relations at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. I do research in electoral behavior. Central theme is on the extent of personalityâ€™s influence upon political attitudes and behavior. I have been interested in categorical data analysis, mixed-effects models, structural equation modeling, and experimental analysis.
