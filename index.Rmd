I received my Ph.D. from Koç University in November 2020, with the dissertation titled “Rising Conservatism in the Face of Threats.” I held a predoctoral fellowship (2019-2020) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Political Science. My primary research agenda is about political behavior, experimental analysis, survey research, and text as data methods.
