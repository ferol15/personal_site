<p style="color:black"><p style="color:black">I received my Ph.D. from Koç University (in Istanbul, Turkey) in November 2020, with the dissertation titled “Rising Conservatism in the Face of Threats.” I held a predoctoral fellowship (2019-2020) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Department of Political Science. My primary research agenda examines political behavior and psychology, experimental analysis, survey research, and text-as-data methods.</p>

<p style="color:black">I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Koç University, working in the national election study project "Issue Voting and Polarization in Turkey," which is funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK). My job responsibilities include developing and analyzing the online Qualtrics-based Q-method on issue polarization, delivering theoretically informed and methodologically robust automated text analytic estimates of issue polarization based on open-ended survey responses and publicly available street interviews encoded in a standardized quantifiable form, and designing and assisting in running the nationally representative face-to-face survey (e.g., the questionnaire design, pilot testing of the inventory with the online samples, the sampling, weight calculation, and supervision of the interviewers in the field). </p>
