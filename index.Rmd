<p style="color:black"><p style="color:black">I received my Ph.D. from Ko√ß University (in Istanbul, Turkey) in November 2020. I held a predoctoral fellowship (2019-2020) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Department of Political Science. Political behavior and psychology, survey research, experimental analysis, and text-as-data methods are my main areas of expertise. I have practical experiences in various advanced quantitative research methods, such as categorical data analysis, multilevel models, and structural equation modeling (SEM). I am proficient in both Stata and R and prefer the latter for open science purposes.</p>
