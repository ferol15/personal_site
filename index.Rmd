<p style="color:black"><p style="color:black">I am a Research Scientist and Lab Manager at the Arizona Policy Lab in the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona. I am also an (on-leave) Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Yeditepe University. I received my Ph.D. from Ko√ß University in 2020. I held a predoctoral fellowship (2019-2020) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Department of Political Science. My primary research agenda covers comparative political behavior, political psychology, causal inference, and measurement.</p>
