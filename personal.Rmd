I am happily married to <a href="https://gsssh.ku.edu.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emine-Arı_CV_.pdf">Emine Arı. </a> Emine is also a Ph.D. candidate in International Relations at Koc University, Department of International Relations in Istanbul, Turkey. If I happen to have sparse time, I enjoy angling and cycling.
